Hide Activities Button
======================

A simple GNOME Shell extenstion to hide the Activities button from the
status bar. 

## Installation instructions

It's best to install it from [GNOME's extensions
website](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/744/hide-activities-button/).

But if you want to do it manually, you can:

0. Clone this project into your machine.
1. Move the Hide_Activities@shay.shayel.org directory into
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extenstions/
2. Press `Alt+F2`, and in the window that opens, type `r` and enter to
restart GNOME shell.  
2.a If you get an error message saying `Restart is not available in Wayland`, simply save your work and then log out / log back in again.
3. Enable the extension by using gnome-tweak-tool, or from the [web
interface](https://extensions.gnome.org/local/)
